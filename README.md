- 👋 Hi, I’m @JonasHopkins
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS50, as well as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After I learn those main pillars so to speak I would like to start learning React and Python :)
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything just yet, simply because I'm not comfortable enough with my knowledge to feel like I would be worth a collaboration. However, once I have more knowledge under my belt, I would love to collaborate on all sorts of projects!
